# Data-Engineer-Project
Repository for the Tampa Bay Rays Data Engineer Project

## Overview
This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that allows the user to create a baseball card for any baseball player

## Output
The Notebook is divided in chunks of code that allows the user to preview different aspects of the baseball card as well of a final chunk of code that generates an output in the form of an Excel file (.xlsx extension).

## Challenges
* Due to the different stats utilized between pitchers and hitters, as well as the career length between different players, I refrained from further formatting the Excel file in order to keep the code shorter
* I could not find the logos in the MLB Stats API so I didn't include it in the card
